## Project:
This is a webpage where you can share your gamer profile. Here you can share your favorite games, streamers and channels (I used Twitch channels, but you can adapt to YouTube or any other). You can also share your social networks.

This project was made through the event "Next Level Week - eSports", more specifically the "Explorer" trail, presented by Rocketseat in September 2022.

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.

## Next steps:
> It's missing the Favicon image. <br><br>
> This project can be adapted to other subjects (books, movies, etc).
